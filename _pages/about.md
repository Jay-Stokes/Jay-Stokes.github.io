I work in the Cloud and Infrastructure Security Group in Microsoft Research, and my primary area of interest is using machine learning, artificial intelligence and signal processing for computer security. I am particularly interested in understanding how deep learning can improve computer security. In the past, I have also done research in the areas of audio signal processing, adaptive filtering, statistical signal processing, biomedical signal processing and wireless communications.

I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Auburn University, my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Colorado, and my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington.
